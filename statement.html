      <p>This work was created to show the only possible way of depicting an invisible material in a two dimensional medium, capturing the viewer's curiosity while maintaining a level of threat in this dark environment. Any other attempts to convincingly prove the existence of such a material, would have to result in the invention of the material itself.</p>
