### 📄 Artist's Statement
This work was made to show the only possible way of depicting invisibility through a two dimensional medium that would encompass the feelings of curiousity and also threat, when encountering an invisible object. Any other attempts to prove such an invention would have to result in the creation of that very invention itself.
